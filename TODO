- Oof! the whole approach so far has been wrong

New TODOs
- Create installer using archinstall
-- Initially, assume HW config and target game (hp minipc and +R)
- Needs to launch steam for authentication, game download and configuration on first boot

So then, packages need updating:
- basics
- archinstall
- python

Remaining packages are added via archinstall
